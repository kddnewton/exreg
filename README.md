# TODO

## Hard (impossible?) to implement in a DFA

* Non-greedy repetition (`*?`, `+?`)
* Capturing
* Subexpression calls
* Assertions (lookahead/lookbehind)

## Possible and should be implemented

* Anchors
* Character class inversion
* Character set inversion
* Character set composition
* Case-insensitive mode
* Multi-line mode
* Free-spacing mode
