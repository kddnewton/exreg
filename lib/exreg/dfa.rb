module Exreg
  # This module contains classes that make up the deterministic state machine
  # representation of the regular expression.
  module DFA
    # This class is responsible for compiling an NFA into a DFA. It does this
    # through a process called powerset construction or subset construction.
    #
    # The general idea is to eagerly walk through the state machine and simulate
    # each possible input at the epsilon-closure of each state. (The
    # epsilon-closure of a state is the set of states that can be reached from
    # that state by following epsilon transitions.) Then, each set of states
    # reached by each transition is a new state in the DFA.
    #
    # Note that doing this eagerly has its drawbacks. For an NFA of n states,
    # the worst-case corresponding DFA could have as many as 2^n states. This
    # can be impractical for large NFAs.
